# AegonCalculatorV2
Welcome to the second iteration of the Aegon Calculator, made by Tjieco van Donselaar.

The purpose of this application is to test the programmer's capabilities using an example project.

To run this project, execute the following commands in the following places:

- inside the root of "calculator", execute 
> ./mvnw spring-boot:run
- Inside the root of "calculatorFrontend", execute
> ng serve

Due to time constraints, the application is not perfect. The following would be next on the priority list if provided with more than 2 day parts:

- More test coverage
- Better error handling
- Better looking UI
